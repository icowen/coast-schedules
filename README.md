# COAST Court Availability

To book a court at COAST, you need to wait for them to be "released" each Friday at a random time of the day.

This is very annoying and leads to favoritism (ie. manager can tell people right before they are released).

Especially when boys and girls teams are playing at the same time, court space can become very limited and hard to get.

This python script pulls the API from MindBody and alerts when any new court space opens up for the next week.

I will use this script to reserve all open court space and sell them to the highest bidder to become ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘**RICH!!!**ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘
